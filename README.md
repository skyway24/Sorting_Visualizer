# Sorting Visualizer

### Objective
Create a web application using HTML, CSS, Javascript to visualize how various sorting algorithms work.

### Motivation
We have learnt sorting algorithms like bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, quick sort. But often we fail to understand the core idea of a particular algorithm maybe because we are unable to visualize how they work. So the most important thing to understand about these algorithms is visualization.
That’s why I am making this project to let everyone understand how these algorithms work.

### High-Level-Approach
* Creating the website's User Interface (UI) using HTML, CSS and enhancing it further using Bootstrap; without actually implementing any of the app's core features.
* Implementation of animations, effects and core functionalities (sorting algorithms) using JavaScript.
* Publish to GitHub.

### Features
I have embeded the 'Size Slider' and 'Speed Slider' to chagne the size of the array and sorting speed of the algorithm. 

### Future Goals
I will add an area which will show the selected sorting algorithm and visual step by step approach of it. Along with this, I will embed a feature through which a user can enter its own custom array and visually learn sorting algorithm.

#### Instructions
Clone the GitHub repo on your local machine. Navigate to the project folder and open homepage.html to run this project locally on your desktop.
